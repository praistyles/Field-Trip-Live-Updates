            <p>Good evening platinum eagles <br> ​It takes effort to set aside time and show up, and that step you took is a huge part of your faith journey. Being here means you’re choosing to grow, learn, and connect—and that’s exactly where God meets you! Don't just sit back; jump into everything we're doing from the 11 to the 12 during our directors visit ​"Instead, continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."​— 2 Peter 3:18 </p>
